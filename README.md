# E-commerce Microservices Application

This is a modern e-commerce application built using microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Java. The application is designed to handle various e-commerce operations through independent, loosely coupled services.

## Architecture Overview

The application is composed of the following microservices:

### 1. Order Service
- Handles order management and processing
- Integrates with other services using OpenFeign and RestTemplate
- Features:
  - Order creation
  - Order validation
  - Integration with Customer service
  - Integration with Product service
  - Payment process initiation
  - Order confirmation notifications via Kafka

### 2. Customer Service
- Manages customer-related operations
- Features:
  - Customer information management
  - Customer lookup functionality

### 3. Product Service
- Manages product-related operations
- Features:
  - Product inventory management
  - Product information management

### 4. Notification Service
- Handles system notifications
- Uses Kafka for asynchronous message processing
- Features:
  - Order confirmation notifications

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java 24
- **Dependencies:**
  - Spring MVC
  - Jakarta EE
  - Lombok
  - Spring Cloud OpenFeign
  - Spring Kafka
  - Spring Validation
  - RestTemplate
  - Exception Handling

## Inter-Service Communication

The application uses different communication patterns:
- **Synchronous Communication:** OpenFeign, RestTemplate
- **Asynchronous Communication:** Apache Kafka
- **Service Discovery:** (To be implemented)

## Features

- Distributed system architecture
- Microservices-based design
- Exception handling with custom Business Exceptions
- Validation using Jakarta Validation
- Async event processing
- REST API endpoints

## Getting Started

(This section will be updated with setup instructions as the application progresses)

## Service Endpoints

### Order Service
- `POST /orders` - Create a new order

### Customer Service
- Customer-related endpoints (To be documented)

### Product Service
- Product-related endpoints (To be documented)

### Notification Service
- Notification-related endpoints (To be documented)

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of service discovery
- Addition of API gateway
- Implementation of circuit breakers
- Addition of distributed tracing
- Implementation of centralized logging
- Addition of monitoring and metrics
- Implementation of security features
